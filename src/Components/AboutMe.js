        The importance of "feeling good" became obvious to me at a very young
        age. Growing up in an immigrant household, I was fortunate to have daily
        home cooked meals filled with whole foods and plenty of love. The kind
        of food that made you feel grounded and fulfilled. It was only when I
        would return from a sleepover or being out of the house that I realized
        this is not how all foods make you feel. After an overload of chips,
        sweets and baked good I found myself feeling fatigued and dehydrated.. I
        quickly learned that all foods are not created equally.

        Fast forward a few years and my love for movement was born. As a
        competitive dancer, I was clocking in 20+ hours of dancing a week. I
        loved moving my body and all that came with it. My confidence was rooted
        in the strength and power I felt through every rehearsal and
        performance. After graduating high school, I moved 8 hours up away to
        attend college. Away from family and the routine I was so very used to.
        I found myself struggling to keep myself centered. Alcohol, minimal
        sleep and take-out food all became constants. With my new lifestyle came
        weight gain, anxiety and low self esteem. Desperate to feel like my
        ‘old-self’ I made countless attempts to start a consistent gym regimen.
        Until one day, in my junior year of college, l came across a
        professional female bodybuilder on social media. I was blown away by her
        physique, discipline and confidence. I knew this was what I wanted for
        myself. I became obsessed. Overnight I decided to pursue becoming a
        certified personal trainer on top of rigorous college classes. I hired a
        trainer, bought a meal plan (from an overrated fitness influencer) and
        truly began to eat, sleep and breathe fitness. I religiously
        meal-prepped, counted every calorie, worked out 6-7 days a week and
        drank no less than a gallon of water every.single.day. I can’t tell you
        how many times I went to dinner with friends and only ordered
        vegetables, to go with my meal prepped chicken breast that I had stashed
        in my purse. Any time I had a meal with my family I was very adamant
        that they understood I would not eat anything that was cooked with salt,
        oil or sauce. Most times this meant my mom had to prepare a completely
        separate meal to cater to the dietary restrictions I had put on myself.
        I dreaded family gatherings, vacations, hangouts with friends… pretty
        much anything that took me away from my routine was more anxiety
        inducing than enjoyable.

        This continued for years. Until it suddenly all caught up to me. The
        years of dieting, food restriction and over exercising were suddenly
        being overturned by my body begging me to come back down to earth. My
        relationship with food was beyond toxic. My relationship with my body
        was fragile. My identity was entirely dependent on whether or not I
        could abide by the rules I had given myself. I became so burnt out from
        my extreme lifestyle and at the same time felt like I didn’t recognize
        this ‘weak’ person I was becoming. For years, I silently battled binge
        eating disorder and body dysmorphia. Everyday I told myself I just
        needed to go back to my disciplined ways, to have more self control, to
        step it up and quit making excuses. I had no idea the depths of my
        damage. It finally got to the point where I realized I needed more than
        willpower. I did my research and was absolutely blown away by my
        findings. I uncovered the ‘dark side’ of fitness and diet culture. After
        many books and lots of self work. I finally healed my relationship with
        food and more importantly my relationship with my mind and body.

        After 7 years of being a personal trainer, I knew it wasn’t going to be
        enough for me. During training sessions with clients, I found myself
        wanting to talk about things beyond their workouts and nutrition. I
        prided myself on being more than just a personal trainer to my clients.
        I wanted to make sure they knew I was there to talk about anything and
        everything that was impacting their mind, body and spirit. I found a
        revolutionary health coaching program at the Institute for Integrative
        Nutrition. Marrying my love for movement with my deep passion for
        nutrition plus my innate desire to hold space for people _______ (name
        of brand) was born. Today I’m living out my dream as a health coach. We
        will widen the lens to see what contributes to a happy and healthy life
        for you. Together, my clients and I do the work. Together we look at
        every aspect of their life to find untapped magic and old wounds. The
        journey is a unique ride, but we’re certainly in it together.
